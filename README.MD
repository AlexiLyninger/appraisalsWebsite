This is a website for the appraisal company, Tritech Appraisals. The website is fully responsive and has multiple pages, accessible through links that can be found in either the header or footer. The header uses a menu icon for the navigation links on mobile screen sizes.

On the Contact page, there is a contact form. The form uses regular expressions to validate user input. If input is not valid, a message informing the user of invalid entry is shown and submission of data is prevented. The form includes a message field with a 250 character limit that displays a character count below it.

The formâ€™s submitted values are stored in the Pantry API. Upon successful submission of the form, the submitted values are retrieved back from the API and displayed in a modal to confirm their submission.
