                    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                    <p>We strive to provide appraisals to clients with the highest level 
                        of integrity, service, and professionalism. Tritech Appraisals 
                        has the abilities and resources to handle all 
                        of your needs for machinery and equipment, whether regionally, 
                        nationally, or internationally. All of our lead appraisers are 
                        experienced in the listing and valuation of a wide variety of 
                        industries.</p>
                    <p>Some appraisal firms have separate personnel list equipment — sometimes 
                        without a professional appraiser present — while other employees, 
                        who have never seen those items, place the values. With Tritech 
                        Appraisals, it will be the same appraisers that both list your 
                        equipment and assess its final value because we pride ourselves on 
                        doing our work professionally, from start to finish.</p>
